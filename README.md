# UniversityHackathon
This repository contains the code and resources for an innovative decentralized identity solution built on the C-Chain, focusing on consensus with a voting scheme. The application leverages Ethereum account authentication and ENS usernames to provide users with simplified access to various decentralized services. Additionally, it offers a secure way to connect to applications on both the Filecoin and Avalanche networks, ensuring a personalized journey for users while maintaining a high level of security through SpruceID integration.

Features
Decentralized Identity Solution: Users can establish and manage their decentralized identities using Ethereum accounts and ENS usernames. This offers a secure and user-friendly way to interact with the application.

Voting Scheme with Consensus: The application employs a voting scheme with consensus mechanisms to make important decisions within the ecosystem. This ensures that the community has a say in the direction of the platform.

Bridge Between Filecoin and Avalanche: A groundbreaking feature of this application is the first-of-its-kind bridge between the Filecoin and Avalanche networks. This bridge allows users to securely transfer data and assets between the two networks, enhancing interoperability.

Personalized Journey: The integration of ENS usernames enables users to enjoy a personalized journey within the decentralized platform. This provides a seamless and unique experience tailored to each user.

SpruceID Integration: To ensure the highest level of security, the application incorporates SpruceID, a cutting-edge identity verification system. This adds an extra layer of trust and authenticity to user interactions.
